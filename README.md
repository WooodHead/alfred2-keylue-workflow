# Keylue (Key Clue): Alfred 2 Workflow for Menu Bar and Keyboard Maestro Hot Key Search


It is like [KeyCue][KeyCue] which helps you memorize or quickly launch hot keys. But it is still too much to pinpoint a shortcut from a 50+ entries with your eyeball. This workflow gives the freedom to search and filter the results and execute them from Alfred.




## Usage

1. keyword `kc`: Show menu items and Keyboard Maestro hot keys. Hit `Enter` to execute.

    The feedback results for each application are cached for speedy response. The cached results are reloaded if it is older than an hour.

2. To refresh cached feedback, begine or end the {query} with `!` like:
    - `kc ! {query}`
    - `kc {query} !`

3. To filter `âŒ˜`, `âŒ¥`, set up a typing expansion using [TextExpander](!g "TextExpander"), [Keyboard Maestro](!g "Keyboard Maestro"), etc.

4. To show only **Keyboard Maestro** hot keys, type `Keyboard Maestro:` in the {query}.
